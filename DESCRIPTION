Description: Provides tools for spatio-temporal disaggregation of areal data across multiple 
    time points, including support for changing polygon boundaries. Combines polygon-level 
    observations, population rasters and optional covariate rasters to infer fine-scale 
    spatial fields over time. Models can be efficiently fit using TMB (template model 
    builder) and adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature for fast approximate inference
    or via tmbstan for MCMC.
